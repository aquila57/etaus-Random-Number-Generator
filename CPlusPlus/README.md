C++ implementation of the etaus random number generator with
a Bays-Durham shuffle.

The etaus class is called Etaus.

Test this class with the binomial distribution test and the
dieharder tests.  You are welcome to add more random number
tests for this Etaus class.

Install programs with inst.sh.

De-install programs with deinst.sh.

Test by running

./binom              # run binomial distribution test

./tstdie.sh          # run dieharder tests on Etaus
